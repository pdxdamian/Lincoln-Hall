		<h1>Lincoln Hall</h1>
		<p>A brief history of Portland State University's Lincoln Hall </p>
    <p> Built in 1911, Lincoln Hall was Portland State's University's "first home". It was designed by Morris Whitehouse (whose work also includes the Gus Solomon United States Courthouse) and  constructed on a cow pasture owned by steamboat shipping magnate Jacob Kamm. The four floor hall was originally used by Lincoln High School, and it served 1,580 students. After the Vanport floods of 1948, the Oregon State Board of Higher education bought the building for use as the new Vanport Extension Center, which couldn't move in until 1952 due to remodeling delays. When the move eventually occurred, Vanport Extension Center was absorbed by the Portland Extension Center, and they together merged into the Portland State Extension Center, which became Portland State College in 1955. 

While it has primarily acted as a home to the aforementioned secondary and post-secondary educational institutions, Lincoln Hall has been used for a variety of local events, including mayoral debates, The Oregon Ballet Theater, and the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art. 

Today, Lincoln Hall houses the Office of the Dean, the School of Music and Theater, and the School of Film, and its amenities for students of these programs include theaters, workshops,  rehearsal studios, classrooms, and a film studio. The Recital Hall, which seats 220 people, as well as the 475 seat Lincoln Performance Hall (the largest in the College of the Arts) , are both located on the ground floor.
